                        <h4>Stationary</h4>
                        <p>In our modern world, everything moves at a fast pace and most people don't have the time to send handwritten cards anymore. However, nothing brings as much joy or expresses the creativity of a personalized card for every occasion. Armed with vintage cards and a variety of craft supplies, Dez makes sure to help celebrate everyone they can.</p>

                        <h4>Pin Flag</h4>
                        <p>Collectables can mean many things to many people, but to Dez, the enamel pins, buttons, and keychains mark points in time to remember. There is no consistency to the collection itself, but covers trips, friends, and life events. Everything is displayed daily in their room, adorned to a smiley-face flag, passed down to them from their mom.</p>

                        <h4>Video Games</h4>
                        <p>Video games have been a part of Dez's life for as long as they can remember, and it's always been a place to relax and discover. Their favorite game is the original Spyro on the Playstation, which they have the downloadable version on their Playstation 3 and the Reignite Trilogy remake on their Nintendo Switch. They find the interactivity of games allows them to explore thoughts and emotions in new or abstract ways. Whether they are working through the journey of Kentucky Route Zero, feeling the pain of life through This War of Mine, or just goofing around in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, they believe that there is always something to find in the time we spend elsewhere.</p>
